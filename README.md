**Algorithm Challenge – Level 3 | #51**
**Update Client by Account Number (C++)**
-
**🧮 Problem Description**
-
This challenge demonstrates how to update an existing client record stored in a text file.

Because text files do not support in-place updates, the program applies a safe update strategy by modifying data in memory and rewriting the file.

**🔧 Algorithm Workflow**
-
📂 Open the client file automatically

📤 Load all records into memory

🔎 Search for the client by Account Number

✏️ Modify the client data

♻️ Rewrite the entire file with updated records

**💡 New Programming Concept**
-
**Read–Modify–Rewrite Pattern** 
A common technique used when working with immutable data sources like text files.

**📂 Important File Note**
--
⚠️ The file used in this program exists on **my local machine.**
Anyone applying this idea must:

Create their own text file

Ensure correct file path and permissions

All file operations are handled automatically by the program.
